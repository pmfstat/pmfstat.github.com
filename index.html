		<h1>pmfstat - PHP's major featureset statistics</h1>

		<p>Developers of PHP-based applications often face the question
		which features of the PHP platform they can rely on. Due to the
		amount of configuration options and features of this open source
		project this is hard to guess.</p>

		<p><i>pmstat</i> aims at providing a framework which can be used
		by multiple projects to gather this kind of information by
		extending popular open source applications with a reporting
		infrastructure. This started as an experimental project for
		phpMyFAQ but the idea was implemented in other projects like
		phpBB.</p>

		<p>This project aims at creating a unified code base and a
		common reporting system.</p>

		<p>Currently these implementations are known:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>phpMyFAQ:
			<ul>
				<li>Data Collection: https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/blob/master/phpmyfaq/inc/PMF_Helper/Questionnaire.php#L133</li>
				<li>Questionaire: https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/blob/master/phpmyfaq/install/setup.php#L969</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>phpBB:
			<ul>
				<li>Questionaire: https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb3/tree/develop-olympus/phpBB/includes/questionnaire</li>
				<li>Data collection server: https://github.com/naderman/stats-o-matic/tree/master/app_server</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul>

		<p>This project contains the following components:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/pmfstat/pmfstat_collector">Data collection libraries</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/pmfstat/pmfstat_server">A central data collection server</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/pmfstat/pmfstat_viewer">A reprting GUI (currently XUL-based)</a></li>
		</ul>
